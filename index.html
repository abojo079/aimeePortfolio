        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <img src="aimeeb.jpeg"/>

<p>My name is Aimee and I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. I attended and graduated from North Miami Beach High School in 1998. I joined the United States Army in 1998 and was in service
    for approximately 8 years. I did several tours in Iraq and in Afganistan between the years of 2001 and 2005. After I was honorably discharged from the military I decided to obtain my Bacherlors Degree.
</p>
<p>I obtained my Bachelors in Criminal Justice with a minor in Internatonal Relations at Florida International University in 1998. I did some contracting work here and there for approximately three to four years and decided to go back to school afterwards.</p>
<p>I went back to Florida International University and obtained a Masters in Public Administration with a focus in Homeland Security and Emergency Management and graduated in 2012. I obtained a job at Miami-Dade Fire Rescue as an Emergency Management a few months prior to my graduation. I still currently work at Miami-Dade Fire Rescue and I've worked large scale emergency management events such as Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Dorian.</p>
